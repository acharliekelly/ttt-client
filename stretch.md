# Stretch Goals

Once (and only once) you've satisfied the core requirements, here are some
additional goals that you can shoot for:

-   If allowing players to compete from separate devices, **display a
    "Waiting..." message** while users are waiting to be matched.
-   Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter.
-   Allow players to **customize their tokens** (X, O, name, picture, etc).
-   **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects or animations to
    spiff things up.
-   Add **tableside chat** to your game.
-   **Use localStorage** to persist data locally, allowing games to continue
    after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity.
